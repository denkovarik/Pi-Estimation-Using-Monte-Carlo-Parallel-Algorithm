# Pi Estimation Using Monte Carlo Parallel Algorithm

## Introduction
This program runs the Monte Carlo Algorithm to estimate a quarter pi. Suppose we toss darts randomly at a square dartboard whose sides are 1 ft in length. Suppose also that there is a quarter circle segment with radius 1 ft inscribed in the square dartboard, from the top left corner, to the lower right corner. If the points that are hit by the darts are uniformly distributed (and always landing in the square), then the number of darts that hit inside the circle segment versus the total number of darts thrown should approximately satisfy a quarter of π: 

                        π / 4 = darts inside cicle segment / total number of darts tossed

This is a so called Monte Carlo process, as it uses randomness to solve a problem.
